# ClusteringAlgorithms

Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters. 

Since the task of clustering is subjective, the means that can be used for achieving this goal are plenty. Every methodology follows a different set of rules for defining the ‘similarity’ among data points. In fact, there are more than 100 clustering algorithms known. But few of the algorithms are used popularly, let’s look at them in detail:

The dataset we are using is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of Portuguese banking institutions and is traditionally used for supervised learning discussion. However it contains some information about bank clients which we will try to cluster ‘a priori’
